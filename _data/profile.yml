  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS),
    advised by
    <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ooiwt/" target="_blank">Prof. Wei Tsang Ooi</a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.etis-lab.fr/2022/01/17/simon-chane-camille/" target="_blank">Prof. Camille Simon Chane</a>.
    Previously, I conducted research with Prof. Stefan Leutenegger
    and Prof. Matthias Nießner
    at the Technical University of Munich (TUM),
    where I earned an M.Sc. in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence (with distinction).
    I also hold a B.Eng. in Vehicle Engineering from Tongji University, Shanghai.

  <p>
    My research lies at the intersection of <strong>3D computer vision</strong> and <strong>multimodal, large-scale deep learning</strong>. 
    I explore how heterogeneous signals, including language, depth maps, point clouds, and event streams, 
    can be fused to perceive, model, reason about, and generate rich 3D environments.
