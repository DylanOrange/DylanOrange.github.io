My personal webpage, built upon the excellent template by [Shitong Luo](https://github.com/luost26). Many thanks for sharing this amazing work.

## Getting Started

1. First, click the "Use this template" button to create a new repository. The name of the repository should be `<your-github-username>.github.io` (click [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites) to learn more about naming a GitHub Pages repository).

### Running Locally (Debug & Preview)

2. Follow the **step 1** and **step 2** of the instruction [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) to install prerequisites and jekyll.

3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

4. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. Browse to the displayed URL to see the website.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

2. Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).

3. Navigate to your created website, and follow the instructions displayed on the homepage (if any) to finalize the setup.
