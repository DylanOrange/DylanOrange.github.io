UAV has great application potential in avalanche rescue.
In this project, we use different path planning strategies to achieve accurate
and rapid positioning and rescue of victims in avalanche
scenes. We compare the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of
different methods. The results show that iterative methods with
more sensor information have higher efficiency and robustness.
Under the condition of less sensor information, the traditional
geometric method has higher accuracy. The search method
can further improved by exploring field-based direct search
methods. At the same time, the coverage efficiency of UAVs
has been proved to be much higher than that of humans, which
provides a simulation basis for future practical applications.
